# The employees poll app. React-Redux project

## Introducing
The employees poll app is the final project I developed as part of my training at Udacity. This app can be used for internal employee polls. I used React, Redux, React-router-dom, and Jest to build the app.

- total number of votes
- the number of votes for a certain option in quantitative and percentage ratio
